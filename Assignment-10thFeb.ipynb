    "The open(), you declare a variable for it first. The open() function takes up to 3 parameters – the filename, the mode, and the encoding.\n",

    "The with statement works with the open() function to open a file.\n",
    "with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "    There is nothing special in open() which makes it usable with the with statement and the same functionality can be provided in user defined objects. Supporting with statement in your objects will ensure that you never leave any resource open.\n",
    "    To use with statement in user defined objects you only need to add the methods __enter__() and __exit__() in the object methods. \n",
